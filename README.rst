This repository belongs to Elijah Perez. This repository contains two machine learing projects in Python (Pytorch). 

FCNeuralNet.py:
This file implements a fully connected neural network. This neural net uses the MNIST data set of hand drawn digits. It then learns from this data set. After learning, it can predict the true value of a drawn digit with high accuracy.

ConvNeuralNet.py:
This file implements a convolutional neural network (CNN). This CNN uses the Kaggle Cats and Dogs Datase found on Microsoft's website (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765). This file contains full detail images of cats and dogs. The CNN learns from these images. After learning, the CNN can differentiate between cat and dog images.
